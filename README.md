## Technologies Used

### Frontend

The frontend of this project is built using **Power BI**, which is used to create interactive and visually rich dashboards. Power BI allows users to explore business data through various visualizations such as:

- **Bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and tables** to present key metrics.
- **Interactive filtering and drill-down** features for detailed analysis.
- **Dynamic report views** for users to focus on the most relevant data.

The dashboards are designed to provide real-time insights and actionable business intelligence across the domains of **Finance**, **Sales**, **Marketing**, and **Supply Chain**.

### Backend

The backend of this project integrates data from multiple sources for analysis and visualization:

- **SQL Database**: The primary source of structured business data, which is queried to fetch key metrics related to finance, sales, and inventory.
- **Excel Files**: External Excel files are used to import additional data for detailed analysis and to supplement the database information.
- **Power Query**: Data is transformed and cleaned using Power Query, ensuring that it is formatted and shaped properly for analysis. This includes removing duplicates, handling missing values, and performing data type conversions.
- **Data Model**: The data from both SQL and Excel sources are integrated into a Power BI data model, which defines relationships between tables and ensures that data is correctly represented in the visualizations.
